    Real-time data processing pipelines

##Personal reflection

    I chose the backend engineer role because I enjoy building robust, scalable systems and working close to core logic and data flow—especially in performance-critical contexts like messaging platforms. My current skillset covers foundational areas like networking, databases, and basic system design, but I lack depth in modern distributed systems tooling and observability practices. Compared to job market demands, I’m missing hands-on experience with production-grade message queues and cloud-native infrastructure. This semester, I’d like to focus on learning Kafka (or a similar event streaming platform) and gaining practical experience with distributed tracing and metrics collection, as these are repeatedly emphasized in real-world backend roles and directly relevant to systems like Telegram’s message propagation pipeline.
